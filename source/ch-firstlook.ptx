  <title>A First Look at Differential Equations: Modeling with Differential Equations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In Calculus we learned that the derivative of a function measures 
        the rate of change of said function (while, e.g., the second 
        derivative measures the curvature of said function). An equation relating a function to 
        one or more of its derivatives is called a <term>differential 
            equation</term>. The subject of differential equations is 
        one of the most interesting and useful areas of mathematics. 
        We can describe many interesting natural phenomena that involve 
        change using differential equations. In addition, the theory 
        of the subject has broad and important implications.</p>
