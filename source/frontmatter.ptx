    <p>This text is intended for a one-semester undergraduate course
       in ordinary differential equations.</p>

    <p>There are additional exercises and computer projects throughout 
      the lecture notes. The computer projects often require a basic 
      knowledge of Python/SageMath and GeoGebra. All of these exercises and 
      projects are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration 
      of new results and theory.</p>

    <p>SageMath (<url href="http://sagemath.org"></url>) is a 
      free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics, 
      which is ideal for assisting with a study of ordinary 
      differential equations. SageMath can be used either on your own 
      computer, a local server, or on CoCalc 
      (<url href="https://cocalc.com"></url>). 
      The SageMath code in this document has been tested for accuracy with the most 
      recent version available at this time: Sage Version 10.3 
      (released 2024<ndash />03<ndash />19).</p>
