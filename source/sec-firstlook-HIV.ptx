  <title>Modeling the HIV-1 Virus</title>

  <p>The interaction of the HIV-1 virus with the body's immune 
    system can be modeled by a system of differential equations 
    similar to a predator-prey system. After an individual is 
    infected with the HIV-1 virus, the amount of the virus in the 
    bloodstream rises dramatically and the person will often suffer 
    from flu-like symptoms. However, these symptoms will disappear 
    after a period of weeks or months as the body begins to 
    manufacture antibodies against the virus. Tests have been 
    developed to determine the presence of HIV-1 antibodies. If an 
    individual has such antibodies, then they are said to be 
    HIV-1 positive. Once infected with the HIV-1 virus, it can 
    be years before an HIV-positive patient exhibits the full 
    symptoms of AIDS. The body's immune system fights the HIV-1 
    virus with white blood cells. The CD4-positive T-helper cells, 
    a specific type of white blood cell, is especially important 
    since it helps other cells fight the virus. However, the HIV-1 
    virus can destroy CD4-positive T-helper cells.</p>

  <p>We can develop a system of differential equations to better 
    understand the dynamics of the HIV-1 virus 
    <xref ref="perelson-2002"/>. 
    Let <m>V = V(t)</m> be the population of the HIV-1 virus at 
    time <m>t</m>. We will assume that the virus concentration 
    is governed by the following differential equation,
      <me>\frac{dV}{dt} = P - cV.</me>
    The first term, <m>P</m> is some function of <m>t</m> that 
    determines the rate at which new viral particles are created. 
    The term <m>-cV</m> is the death rate for the virions. If 
    someone discovers a drug that blocks the creation of new 
    HIV-1 virions, then <m>P</m> would be zero and the virions 
    would clear the body at the following rate,
      <me>\frac{dV}{dt} = - cV,</me>
    and <m>V(t) = V_0 e^{-ct}</m>, where <m>V_0</m> is the initial 
    viral population.</p>

    <p>Now let us consider a model for the concentration of 
        <m>T = T(t)</m> of (uninfected) CD4-positive T-helper cells,
      <me>\frac{dT}{dt} = s + pT\left(1 - \frac{T}{T_{\text{max}}}  \right) - d_T T.</me>
    The constant <m>s</m> represents the rate at which T cells are 
    created from sources in the body, such as the thymus. New 
    CD4-positive T-helper cells can also be created from the 
    proliferation of existing CD4-positive T-helper cells, and the 
    second term in the equation represents the logistic growth of 
    the T cells, where <m>p</m> is the maximum proliferation rate 
    and <m>T_{\text{max}}</m> is the T cell population density 
    where proliferation ceases. Finally, <m>d_T</m> is the death 
    rate of the T cells.</p>

    <p>Like the influenza virus, the HIV-1 virus is an RNA virus. 
        An RNA virus cannot reproduce on its own and must use the 
        DNA from a host cell. To do this, the virus attaches itself 
        to a CD4-positive T-helper cell and injects its RNA into 
        the cell. This way the virus can use the T cell's DNA to 
        replicate itself using a process called reverse 
        transcription, where a DNA copy of the virus's RNA is made. 
        New virus particles are created, and the T cell eventually 
        bursts releasing the virions into the body. If we let 
        <m>T^*</m> be the concentration of infected T cells, we can 
        model this process with the following system of equations,
        <md>
           <mrow>\frac{dT^*}{dt} &amp; =  kTV - \delta T^*</mrow>
           <mrow>\frac{dV}{dt} &amp; =  N \delta T^* - cV,</mrow>
        </md>
        where <m>\delta</m> is the rate of loss of the virus 
        producing T cells and <m>N</m> is the number of virions 
        produced per infected T cell during its lifetime. The term 
        <m>kTV</m> tells us the rate at which the HIV-1 virus 
        infects T cells. This is the same idea as modeling how 
        predators interact with prey in a predator-prey model. 
        Thus, our complete model becomes
        <md>
           <mrow>\frac{dT}{dt} &amp; =  s + pT\left(1 - \frac{T}{T_{\text{max}}}  \right) - d_T T - kTV</mrow>
           <mrow>\frac{dT^*}{dt} &amp; =  kTV - \delta T^*</mrow>
           <mrow>\frac{dV}{dt} &amp; =  N \delta T^* - cV.</mrow>
        </md></p>

    <p>One class of drugs that HIV infected patients receive are 
        reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors. RT inhibitors 
        block the action of reverse transcription and prevent 
        the virus from duplicating. If one could find the perfect 
        RT inhibitor, then <m>k =0</m> and our system becomes
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{dT}{dt} &amp; = s + pT\left(1 - \frac{T}{T_{\text{max}}}  \right) - d_T T</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dT^*}{dt} &amp; = - \delta T^*</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dV}{dt} &amp; = N \delta T^* - cV.</mrow>
        </md>
        Unfortunately, no one has discovered a perfect RT inhibitor, 
        so we will need to modify the system to account for the 
        effectiveness of the RT inhibitor. We can accomplish this 
        by adding an effectiveness factor, <m>1 - \eta</m>, to the 
        <m>kVT</m> term. Our system now becomes
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{dT}{dt} &amp; =  s + pT\left(1 - \frac{T}{T_{\text{max}}}  \right) - d_T T - k(1 - \eta)TV</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dT^*}{dt} &amp; =  k(1 - \eta)TV - \delta T^*</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dV}{dt} &amp; =  N \delta T^* - cV.</mrow>
        </md>
        If <m>\eta = 1</m>, then the RT inhibitor is completely 
        effective. On the other hand, if <m>\eta = 0</m>, then the 
        RT inhibitor is completely ineffective. We now have a model 
        for how the HIV-1 virus interacts we the immune system. 
        Researchers can use data to estimate the parameters and see 
        exactly what types of solutions are possible.</p>
