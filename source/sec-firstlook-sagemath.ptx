    <title>SageMath <mdash /> Open Source Software</title>
        
        <p>Technology can prove very useful when studying 
            differential equations. Software packages such Maple, 
            Mathematica, and Matlab each have their advantages and 
            disadvantages. We will use <em>SageMath</em>, a readily 
            available open source computer algebra system, as our 
            choice of software. <em>SageMath</em> can be run on an 
            individual computer or over the internet on a server or 
            is available inside <em>CoCalc</em> at 
            <url ref="https://cocalc.com" />. You can even access 
            <em>SageMath</em> from your smart phone. 
            For our purposes, <em>SageMath</em> cells are embedded 
            into the textbook, so there is nothing to install on 
            your computer. Simply, evaluate the cell.  
            You can even change the preloaded commands in the cell 
            if you wish. For example, let us evaluate the derivative 
            of <m>f(x) = x^2 \cos x</m>.</p>
        
                <sage>
                    <input>
                    x = var('x')
                    y = x^2*cos(x)
                    diff(y, x)
                    </input>
                    <output>
                    -x^2*sin(x) + 2*x*cos(x)
                    </output>
                </sage>

                <p>We can use SageMath to plot functions. For example, 
                    we can plot the function <m>f(x) = x^2 \cos x</m> 
                    as well as its derivative on the same graph.</p>

                <sage>
                    <input>
                    x = var('x')
                    y = x^2*cos(x)
                    yprime = diff(y, x)
                    p = plot(y, (x, -2, 2), color ='blue', legend_label='$f$', legend_color='blue')
                    p += plot(yprime, (x, -2, 2), color='red', legend_label='$df/dx$', legend_color='red')
                    p
                    </input>
                </sage>
        
                <p>We can use <em>SageMath</em> to solve 
                    differential equations. Suppose that we wish to 
                    solve the initial value problem
                    <md>
                        <mrow>\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = kP</mrow>
                        <mrow>P(0) &amp; = 1000.</mrow>
                    </md>
                We can use the following commands.</p>

                <sage>
                    <input>
                    k,t = var('k, t') #declare variables k and t
                    P = function('P')(t) #declare P to be a function of t
                    de = diff(P, t) == k*P  #differential equation
                    #solve specifying initial conditions
                    #and independent variable solution
                    solution = desolve(de, P, ivar=t, ics=[0, 1000]) 
                    solution
                    </input>
                    <output>
                    1000*e^(k*t)
                    </output>
                </sage>
        
                <p>We will provide abundant examples of how to 
                    use <em>SageMath</em> to solve and analyze 
                    differential equations throughout the book, 
                    and we encourage the reader to experiment by 
                    altering the SageMath commands inside the 
                    individual Sage cells. If you make a mistake, 
                    you can simply reload the webpage and start 
                    again.</p>

                <p>The reader will find plenty of resources to 
                    learn how to use <em>SageMath</em>.  
                    A good place to start is 
                    <url href="http://www.sagemath.org/help.html" /> 
                    or <xref ref="bard-2015" />.  Although we will 
                    be using <em>SageMath</em> as the technology of 
                    choice, this book can be read independently of 
                    <em>SageMath</em>.  Finally, we would like to 
                    emphasize once again that the reader who chooses not 
                    to use some sort of technology will be at a 
                    disadvantage.</p>
