  <title>Exponential Growth</title>

  <p>We begin our study of ordinary differential equations by 
    modeling some real world phenomena. For a particular situation 
    that we might wish to investigate, our first task is to write 
    an equation (or equations) that best describes the phenomenon. 
    Suppose that we wish to study how a population <m>P(t)</m> 
    grows with time <m>t</m>.  We might make the assumption that 
    a constant fraction of population is having offspring at any 
    particular time. If we also assume that the population has a 
    constant death rate, the change in the population 
    <m>\Delta P</m> during a small time interval <m>\Delta t</m> 
    will be
    <me>\Delta P \approx  k_{\text{birth}} P(t) \Delta t - 
        k_{\text{death}} P(t) \Delta t,</me>
    where <m>k_{\text{birth}}</m> is the fraction of the population 
    having offspring during the interval and 
    <m>k_{\text{death}}</m> is the fraction of the population that 
    dies during the interval. Equivalently, we can write
    <me>\frac{\Delta P}{ \Delta t} \approx k P(t),</me>
    where <m>k =  k_{\text{birth}} - k_{\text{death}}</m>. Since 
    the derivative of <m>P</m> is
    <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = 
        \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta P}{ \Delta t},</me>
    the rate of change of the population is proportional to the 
    size of the population, or
    <men xml:id="equation-firstlook-exponential">\frac{dP}{dt} 
        = kP.</men></p>

    <p>The equation
    <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = kP</me>
    is one of the simplest differential equations that we will 
    consider. The equation tells us that the population grows in 
    proportion to its current size. It is not too difficult to see 
    that <m>P(t) = Ce^{kt}</m> is a <term>solution</term> to this 
    equation, where <m>C</m> is an arbitrary constant.  Indeed, if 
    we differentiate <m>P(t)</m>, we obtain
    <me>\frac{d}{dt} P(t) = kCe^{kt} = kP(t).</me>
    In addition, if we know the value of <m>P(t)</m>, say when 
    <m>t = 0</m>, we can also determine the value of <m>C</m>. 
    For example, if the population at the time <m>t = 0</m> is 
    <m>P(0) = P_0</m>, then
    <me>P_0 = P(0) = Ce^{k \cdot 0} = C</me>
    or <m>P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}</m>. The differential equation
    <md>
        <mrow>P'(t) &amp; = k P(t),</mrow>
        <mrow>P(0) &amp; = P_0</mrow>
    </md>
    is an example of an <term>initial value problem</term>
    <idx><h>initial value problem</h></idx>
    <idx><h>IVP</h><see>initial value problem</see></idx>, 
    and we say that <m>P(0) = P_0</m> is an 
    <term>initial condition</term><idx><h>initial condition</h></idx>. 
    Since the solution to equation 
    <xref ref="equation-firstlook-exponential"/> is 
    <m>P(t) = Ce^{kt}</m>, and we say that the population grows 
    <term>exponentially</term><idx><h>exponential growth</h></idx>.</p>


    <example xml:id="example-exponential-growth">
        <title>Exponential growth of bacteria</title>
        <p>As an example, suppose that <m>P(t)</m> is a population 
            of a colony of bacteria at time <m>t</m>, whose initial 
            population is 1000 at <m>t = 0</m>, where time is 
            measured in hours.  Then
            <me>1000 = P(0) = C e^0 = C,</me>
            and our solution becomes <m>P(t) = 1000e^{kt}</m>. 
            If the population grows at three percent per hour, 
            then
            <me>1030 = P(1) = 1000 e^k,</me>
            after one hour.  Consequently,
            <me>k = \ln 1.03 \approx 0.0296</me>
            and the solution to our initial value problem is 
            <me>P(t) = 1000e^{0.0296 t}.</me>
            Of course, it is important to realize that this is 
            only a model. If <m>t</m> is small, our model might be 
            reasonably accurate. However, if we let <m>t</m> be 
            very large, our colony of bacteria could very well 
            exceed the mass of the earth.</p>
    </example>


    <p>The growth rate of a population need not be positive. For 
        example, Japan has experienced negative growth in recent 
        years.<fn>See 
            <url href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW" />.</fn> The equation <m>dP/dt = kP</m> can also be used to model such phenomena such as radioactive decay and compound interest<mdash/>topics which we will explore later.</p>

    <p>To summarize, we say that the expression 
        <m>x(t) = Ce^{kt}</m> is a <term>general solution</term>
        <idx><h>solution</h><h>general</h></idx> of the equation 
        <m>x' = kx</m>, and <m>x(t) = x_0 e^{kt}</m> is a 
        <term>particular solution</term>
        <idx><h>solution</h><h>particular</h></idx> 
        to the differential equation. The general solution to 
        our equation <m>x(t) = Ce^{kt}</m> graphs as an infinite 
        family of curves, which we will call 
        <term>integral curves</term><idx>
            <h>integral curves</h></idx> or
