  <title>Some Questions for Thought</title>

  <p>In this section we have provided a general notion of what a 
    differential equation is as well as several modeling situations 
    where differential equations are useful; however, we have left 
    many questions unanswered. 
    <ul>
        <li>First, we need a more rigorous definition of a 
            differential equation; so, what is the proper way to 
            define a system of differential equations? </li>
        <li>Does a differential equation or a system of differential 
            equations always have a solution?  </li>
        <li>Are solutions to differential equations unique?</li> 
        <li>If a unique solution to a differential equation exists, 
            (how) can we find it? </li>
        <li>If it is not possible to find a precise solution 
            algebraically, can we estimate the solution numerically? </li> 
        <li>If neither is possible, can we still say anything useful 
            about the solution?</li>
    </ul> 
    Of course, other questions will come to mind as 
    we continue our study of differential equations.</p>
