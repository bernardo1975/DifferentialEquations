  <title>A Predator-Prey System</title>

  <p>Some situations require more than one differential equation to 
    model a particular situation. We might use a system of 
    differential equations to model two interacting species, say 
    where one species preys on the other<fn>The predator-prey 
        model was discovered independently by Lotka (1925) and 
        Volterra (1926).</fn>. For example, we can model how the 
    population of Canadian lynx (<em>lynx canadienis</em>) interacts 
    with a the population of snowshoe hare (<em>lepus americanis</em>) 
    (see <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWucOrSOdCs" />).
  </p>

  <p>We have good historical data for the populations of the lynx 
    and snowshoe hare from the Hudson Bay Company. This large 
    Canadian retail company, which owns and operates a large number 
    of retail stores in North America and Europe, including 
    Galeria Kaufhof, Hudson's Bay, Home Outfitters, 
    Lord &amp; Taylor, and Saks Fifth Avenue, was originally 
    founded in 1670 as a fur trading company. The Hudson Bay 
    Company kept accurate records on the number of lynx pelts that 
    were bought from trappers from 1821 to 1940. The company noticed 
    that the number of pelts varied from year to year and that the 
    number of lynx pelts reached a peak about every ten years 
    <xref ref="elton-1942"/>. The ten year cycle for lynx can be 
    best understood using a system of differential equations.</p>

  <p>The primary prey for the Canadian lynx is the snowshoe hare. 
    We will denote the population of hares by <m>H(t)</m> and the 
    population of lynx by <m>L(t)</m>, where <m>t</m> is the time 
    measured in years. We will make the following assumptions for 
    our predator-prey model.
    <ul>

        <li>If no lynx are present, we will assume that the hares 
            reproduce at a rate proportional to their population 
            and are not affected by overcrowding. That is, the 
            hare population will grow exponentially,
            <me>\frac{dH}{dt} = aH.</me></li>

        <li>Since the lynx prey on the hares, we can argue that 
            the rate at which the hares are consumed by the lynx 
            is proportional to the rate at which the hares and 
            lynx interact.  Thus, the equation that predicts the 
            rate of change of the hare population becomes
                <me>\frac{dH}{dt} = aH - bHL.</me>
            We are thinking of <m>HL</m> as the number of possible 
            interactions between the lynx and the hare populations.
        </li>

        <li>If there is no food, the lynx population will decline 
            at a rate proportional to itself,
            <me>\frac{dL}{dt} = -cL.</me></li>

        <li>The lynx receive benefit from the hare population. 
            The rate at which lynx are born is proportional to 
            the number of hares that are eaten, and this is 
            proportional to the rate at which the hares and lynx 
            interact. Consequently, the growth rate of the lynx 
            population can be described by
            <me>\frac{dL}{dt} = -cL + dHL.</me></li>

    </ul>
    We now have a <term>system</term> of differential equations 
    that describe how the two populations interact,
      <md>
          <mrow>\frac{dH}{dt}  &amp; =  aH - bHL,</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{dL}{dt}  &amp; =  -cL + dHL.</mrow>
      </md >
    We will learn how to analyze and solve systems of differential 
    equations in subsequent chapters; however, we will give a 
    graphical solution in 
    <xref ref="figure-firstlook-lynx-snowshoe-hare"/> 
    to the system
      <md>
          <mrow>\frac{dH}{dt} &amp; =  0.4H - 0.01HL,</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{dL}{dt} &amp; =  -0.3L + 0.005HL.</mrow>
      </md>
    Notice that the predator population, <m>L</m>, begins to grow 
    and reaches a peak after the prey population, <m>H</m> reaches 
    its peak.  As the prey population declines, the predator 
    population also declines. Once the predator population is 
    smaller, the prey population has a chance to recover that the 
    cycle begins again<fn>An excellent account of the actual lynx 
      and snowshoe hare data and model can be found in 
      <xref ref="bauer-2001"/>.</fn>.</p>
