  <title>Logistic Growth</title>

  <p>Not all populations grow exponentially; otherwise, a bacteria culture 
    in a petri dish would grow unbounded and soon be much larger than the 
    size of the laboratory. To see what happens if there are limiting 
    factors to population growth, let us consider the population of fish 
    in a children's trout pond. The number of trout will be limited by 
    the available resources, food supply, and spawning habitat. A small 
    population of fish might grow exponentially if the pond is large and 
    food is abundant, but the growth rate will decline as the population 
    increases and the availability of resources declines.  We can use the 
    <term>logistic equation</term><idx><h>logistic equation</h></idx> 
    to model population growth in a resource limited environment<fn>The 
        logistic model was first used by the Belgian mathematician and 
        physician Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst in 1836 to predict the 
        populations of Belgium and France.</fn>.</p>

  <p>To see how the logistic model works, let us try to adjust our model 
    of exponential growth to account for the limited resources of the 
    pond. We will make the following assumptions.
  <ul>

      <li>If the population of trout is small and the pond is large with 
        abundant resources, the rate of growth will be approximately 
        exponential,
          <me>\frac{dP}{dt} \approx kP.</me></li>

      <li>If <m>N</m> is the maximum population of trout that the pond 
        can support, then any population larger than <m>N</m> will 
        decrease.  In other words,
          <me>\frac{dP}{dt} \lt 0</me>
      for <m>P \gt N</m>.  We say that <m>N</m> is the 
      <term>carrying capacity</term><idx><h>carrying capacity</h></idx> 
      for the population.</li>

  </ul>
  Our assumptions suggest that we might try an equation of the form
      <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = k f(P) P,</me>
  where <m>f(P)</m> is a function of <m>P</m> that is close to 1 if 
  the population is small, but negative if the population is greater 
  than <m>N</m>. The simplest function satisfying these conditions is
      <me>f(P) = \left( 1 - \frac{P}{N} \right).</me>
  Thus, the <term>logistic population model</term> is given by the 
  differential equation
      <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = k \left( 1 - \frac{P}{N} \right) P.</me></p>

  <example xml:id="example-firstlook-logistic-growth">
      <title>Logistic growth of fish</title>
      <p>Suppose we have a pond will support 1000 fish, and the initial 
        population is 100 fish. In order to determine the number of fish 
        in the lake at any time <m>t</m>, we must solve the initial value 
        problem
          <md>
              <mrow>\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = k \left( 1 - \frac{P}{1000} \right) P</mrow>
              <mrow>P(0) &amp; = 100.</mrow>
          </md>
      It is easy to verify that
              <me>P(t) = \frac{1000}{9e^{-kt} + 1}</me>
      is the solution to our initial value problem<fn>We will learn how to 
        solve initial-value problems such as the one described here in 
        Section<nbsp /><xref ref="firstlook02"/>. For the time being, we will 
        be satisfied with being able to verify the fact that we have a 
        solution.</fn>.</p>

      <p>If we differentiate <m>P</m>, we will obtain the righthand side of 
        the differential equation,
          <md>
              <mrow>\frac{dP}{dt} &amp; = \frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{1000}{9e^{-kt} + 1}\right)</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = 1000 k \frac{9e^{-kt}}{(9e^{-kt} + 1)^2}</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = k \frac{9e^{-kt}}{(9e^{-kt} + 1)} \cdot \frac{1000}{9e^{-kt} + 1}</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = k \frac{(9e^{-kt} + 1) - 1}{(9e^{-kt} + 1)} \cdot \frac{1000}{9e^{-kt} + 1}</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = k \left( 1 - \frac{1000}{1000(9e^{-kt} + 1)}\right) \frac{1000}{9e^{-kt} + 1}</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; = k \left( 1 - \frac{P}{1000} \right) P,</mrow>
          </md>
      and certainly <m>P(0) = 100</m>. In addition, if we know that the 
      population is 200 fish after one year, then 
          <me>200 = P(1) = \frac{1000}{9e^{-k} + 1},</me>
      and we can determine that 
          <me>k = \ln\left(  \frac{9}{4}\right) \approx 0.8109.</me>
      Consequently, the solution to our intial-value problem is
          <me>P(t) = \frac{1000}{9e^{-0.8109 t} + 1}.</me>
      The graph of our solution certainly fits the situation that we are 
      modeling (<xref ref="figure-firstlook-logistic-growth"/>).
    </p>

      <p>Of course, we have not allowed for the possibility that children 
        will be catching fish in our pond. We will examine how fishing affects 
        our model in Section<nbsp /><xref ref="firstlook07"/>.</p>
