  <title>A Spring-Mass Model </title>

  <p>Sometimes it is necessary to consider the second derivative when 
    constructing a mathematical model. Suppose that we have a mass lying on a 
    flat, frictionless surface and that this mass is attached to one end of a 
    spring with the other end of the spring attached to a wall. We denote the 
    spring displacement by <m>x</m>. If <m>x \gt 0</m>, then the spring is 
    stretched. If <m>x \lt 0</m>, the spring is compressed. If <m>x = 0</m>, 
    then the spring is in a state of equilibrium 
    (<xref ref="figure-firstlook-spring-mass"/>). 
    If we pull on the mass, then the mass will oscillate back and forth 
    across the table.</p>

  <p>We can construct a differential equation that models our oscillating mass. 
    First, we must consider the restorative force on the spring. We will make 
    the assumption that this force depends on the displacement of the spring, 
    <m>F(x)</m>. Using Taylor's Theorem from calculus, we can expand 
    <m>F</m> to obtain
      <md>
          <mrow>F(x) &amp; =  F(0) + F'(0) x + \frac{1}{2} F''(0) x^2 + \cdots</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = -k x + \frac{1}{2} F''(0) x^2 + \cdots,</mrow>
      </md>
  where <m>F'(0) = -k</m> and <m>F(0) = 0</m>.  If the displacement is not 
  too large, then <m>x^n</m> will be small for <m>n \geq 2</m>, and we can 
  ignore higher ordered terms. Thus, we can consider the restorative force 
  on the spring to be proportional to displacement of the spring from its 
  equilibrium length,
      <me>F = -kx.</me>
  This equation is known as is <term>Hooke's law</term>
  <idx><h>Hooke's law</h></idx>. We can test this law experimentally, and it 
  is reasonably accurate if the displacement of the spring, <m>x</m>, is not 
  too large.</p>

  <p>By Newton's second law of motion, the force on the mass must be
      <me>F = ma = m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = m x''.</me>
  Setting the two forces equal, we have a <term>second order</term> 
  differential equation,
      <me>mx'' = -kx,</me>
  which describes our oscillating mass. The spring-mass system is an example 
  of a <term>harmonic oscillator</term><idx><h>harmonic oscillator</h></idx>.</p>

  <p>Suppose that we have a spring-mass system where <m>m =1</m> and 
    <m>k = 1</m>. If the initial velocity of the spring is one unit per second 
  and the initial position is at the equilibrium point, then we have the 
  following initial value problem,
      <md>
          <mrow>x'' + x &amp; =  0</mrow>
          <mrow>x(0) &amp; =  0</mrow>
          <mrow>x'(0) &amp; =  1.</mrow>
      </md>
  Since <m>x''(t) = - x(t)</m> for both the sine and cosine functions, we 
  might guess that a general solution of our differential equation has the 
  form
      <me>x(t) = A \cos t + B \sin t.</me>
  Noting that
      <me>x'(t) = -A \sin t + B \cos t,</me>
  and using our initial conditions, we can determine that <m>A = 0</m> 
  and <m>B = 1</m> or
      <me>x(t) = \sin t.</me>

  <p>Now let us add a damping force to our system. For example, we might 
    add a dashpot, a mechanical device that resists motion, to our system. 
    Think of a dashpot as that small cylinder that keeps your screen door 
    from slamming shut. The simplest assumption would be to take the damping 
    force of the dashpot to be proportional to the velocity of the mass, 
    <m>x'(t)</m>. Thus, we have will have an additional force,
      <me>F = -b x'</me>
    acting on our mass, where <m>b \gt 0</m>. Our new equation for the 
    spring-mass system is
      <me>mx'' = -bx' - kx.</me>
  or
      <me>mx'' + bx' + kx = 0,</me>
  where <m>m</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>k</m> are all positive constants. If we 
  let <m>m = 1</m>, <m>b = 3</m>, and <m>k = 2</m>, then we would have an 
  spring-mass system governed by the equation
      <me>x'' + 3x' + 2x = 0.</me>
  We will learn how to solve equations of the form <m>ax'' + bx' + cx = 0</m> 
  in <xref ref="secondorder"/>, but let us assume that the 
  solution is of the form <m>x(t) = e^{rt}</m> for now. Then
      <md>
          <mrow>x'' + 3x' + 2x &amp; = r^2 e^{rt} + 3 r e^{rt} + 2 e^{rt}</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = e^{rt}(r^2 + 3r +2)</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = e^{rt}(r+2)(r+1)</mrow>
          <mrow>&amp; = 0.</mrow>
      </md>
  Since <m>e^{rt}</m> is never zero, it must be the case that <m>r = -2</m> 
  or <m>r = -1</m>, if <m>x(t) = e^{rt}</m> is to be a solution to our 
  equation. Thus, we might guess that
      <me>x(t) = A e^{-t} + B e^{-2t}</me>
  is a general solution to our equation. If the initial velocity of our mass 
  is one unit per second and the initial position is zero, then we have the 
  initial value problem
      <md>
          <mrow>x'' + 3x' + 2 x &amp; = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x(0) &amp; = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>x'(0) &amp; = 1.</mrow>
      </md>
  Using the fact that <m>x'(t) = -A e^{-t} -2 B e^{-2t}</m>, our initial 
  conditions give us the following system of linear equations,
      <md>
          <mrow>A + B &amp; = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>-A -2B &amp; = 1.</mrow>
      </md>
  Thus, <m>A = 1</m> and <m>B = -1</m>, and our spring-mass system is 
  modeled by the function
          <me>x(t) =  e^{-t} - e^{-2t}.</me>
  Notice that the additional damping negates any oscillation in the system. 
  In this case, we say that the system is 
  <term>over-damped</term><idx><h>harmonic oscillator</h><h>over-damped</h></idx>

  <p>Of course, if we have a very strong spring and only add a small amount of 
    damping to our spring-mass system, the mass would continue to oscillate, 
    but the oscillations would become progressively smaller. In other words, 
    our system would be <term>under-damped</term>
    <idx><h>harmonic oscillator</h><h>under-damped</h></idx>. 
    For example, our spring-mass system might be described by the initial 
    value problem

          <mrow>x'(0) &amp; = 1.</mrow>
      </md>
  It is easy to verify that
      <me>x(t) = \frac{1}{7} e^{-t} \sin 7t</me>
  is a solution to the initial value problem
