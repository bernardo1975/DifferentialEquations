  <title>Childhood Diseases: The SIR-model</title>

  <p>Differential equations are used to model diseases. Most 
    childhood diseases, such as measels, can be represented 
    diagrammatically by
    <me>S\ \to\ I\ \to\ R.</me>
    Here, we assume that the population consists of susceptibles 
    (<m>S</m>, i.e., persons who are healthy but can acquire the 
    disease), infected (<m>I</m>) and removed (<m>R</m>, either 
    by acquired immunity, isolation or death) persons. Individuals 
    are born susceptible, then may acquire the infection and 
    finally recover. As mathematical model, one thinks of three 
    <em>compartments</em>, labelled S, I and R, and individuals 
    are tranferred between these compartments according to the 
    diagram above<fn>This model was for the first time proposed 
        by the Scottish biochemist William Ogilvy Kermack and the 
        Scottish military physician and epidemiologist Anderson 
        Gray McKendrick as a special case of what we now call 
        Kermack-McKendrick theory, and followed work McKendrick 
        had done with the British medical doctor Ronald Ross; 
        A. G. McKendrick and W. O. Kermack published their theory 
        in a set of three articles from 1927, 1932, and 1933. </fn>. 
    Since susceptible persons become sick when they have contact 
    with infected persons, but recover after a certain time span, 
    a simple model for such an SIR-disease using a system of 
    differential equations is:
    <mdn>
        <mrow number="no">\frac{\operatorname{d}\!{S}}{\operatorname{d}\!{t}} &amp; = -\beta\cdot S\cdot I,</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq-SIR">\frac{\operatorname{d}\!{I}}{\operatorname{d}\!{t}} &amp; = \beta\cdot S\cdot I - \gamma\cdot I,</mrow>
        <mrow number="no">\frac{\operatorname{d}\!{R}}{\operatorname{d}\!{t}} &amp; = \gamma\cdot I.</mrow>
    </mdn>
    The parameter <m>\beta</m> is called the <em>pairwise infectious 
    contact rate</em> and gives the rate of infection when a 
    susceptible meets an infected person. The parameter <m>\gamma</m> 
    is the <em>rate of recovery</em>.</p> 

    <p>Analysing this system of differential equation, one finds: 
        If the fraction of susceptibles is low enough, the fraction 
        of infected persons will decline and the disease will die 
        out. However, if the fraction of susceptibles is higher 
        than a certain threshold, the number of infected people 
        increases: an <em>epidemic</em> occurs. During an epidemic, 
        the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more 
        of them are infected. Afterwards the disease cannot break 
        out again until the number of susceptibles has built back 
        up as a result of newborns.</p> 

    <p>Here, vaccines come into play: A vaccine reduces the number 
        of susceptibles by immunization, thus <mdash> if the enough 
        people are vaccinated </mdash> an epidemic will not break 
        out and the disease will eventually die out. Smallpox was 
        the first (and until recently only<fn>Smallpox was officially 
            declared eradiacted in 1979. Rinderpest was unofficially 
            declared eradicated in 2010.  For an update of the current 
            status for other diseases (e.g., polio), have a look at  
            <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"/>.
        </fn>) disease that was successfully eradicated by this 
        method <mdash /> mainly because the fraction of 
        susceptibles that need to be successfully vaccinated is 
        lower than in other diseases like measels, mumps, 
        diphtheria etc.</p> 

    <p>In the Spanish invasion of South America, the Aztecs were 
        devasted by a smallpox epidemic introduced by one of Cortez' 
        men. In the figure below we used the above system of 
        differential equations to model this situation: The disease 
        was introduced to a wholly susceptible population (blue), 
        the epidemic broke out reaching its high point after 
        approximately three years (the infected are colored in red). 
        Eventually, around <m>98\%</m> suffered from the disease 
        (smallpox is a very deadly disease).</p>
