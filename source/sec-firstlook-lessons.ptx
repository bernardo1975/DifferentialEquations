  <p><ul>
    <li>A <term>differential equation</term> is an equation relating a function to one or more of its derivatives.</li>

    <li>An <term>initial value problem</term> is a differential equation
        <me>\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t,x),</me>
    where the <term>initial condition</term>, <m>x(t_0) = x_0</m>, is specified.</li>

    <li>A population that is not affected by overcrowding can be modeled by the differential equation <m>P' = kP</m> and is said to grow <term>exponentially</term>.</li>

    <li>A population that must compete for limited resources can be modeled by the <term>logistic equation</term>,
        <me>\frac{dP}{dt} = k \left( 1 - \frac{P}{N} \right) P, </me>
    where <m>N</m> is the carrying capacity of the population.</li>

    <li>Some phenomenon, such as the relationship between a population of predators and a population of prey, are best modeled by systems of differential equations.</li>

    <li><p>The three principle steps in modeling any phenomenon with differential equations are:
    <ul>

        <li><p>Discovering the differential equation or equations that best describe a specified physical situation.</p></li>
    
        <li><p>Finding<mdash/>either exactly or approximately<mdash/>the appropriate solution of the equation or equations.</p></li>
    
        <li><p>Interpreting the solution in terms of the phenomenon.</p></li>
    
    </ul></p></li>
</ul></p>
